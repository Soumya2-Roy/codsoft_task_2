#simple calculator

The **Simple Calculator** performs basic arithmetic operations. Users can input two numbers and choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, floor division or power). Here's how it works:

1.**User Input:**

  -The user is prompted to input two numbers.
  -They also select an operation (e.g., + for addition, - for subtraction, * for multiplication, / for division,% for modulus,// for floor division, ** for power).

2.**Perform Calculation:**
  -Based on the user's input, the application performs the chosen arithmetic operation.
  -For example:
    -If the user inputs '5', '3', and selects '+', the result is '8'.
    -If the user inputs '10', '4', and selects '-', the result is '6'.
    -If the user inputs '7', '2', and selects '*', the result is '14'.
    -If the user inputs '15', '5', and selects '/', the result is '3.0'.
    -If the user inputs '5', '5', and selects '%', the result is '0.0'.
    -If the user inputs '15','5', and selects //, the result is '3.0'.
    -If the user inputs '3','2', and selects '**', the result is '9.0'.

3.**Display Result:**
  -The calculated result is displayed on the screen.
4.**Vedio Representation:**
